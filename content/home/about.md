## **Hey there,**

I started my PhD in 2017 at the [Institut de la Vision](http://neuromorphic-vision.com/) in Paris, where I have since experimented with neuromorphic cameras on embedded systems. I work on gesture recognition on mobile phones as well as [face detection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UzXQsr5Es) with event-based cameras. More recently I started to explore some neural computation principles on Loihi, a novel neuromorphic chip. I'm also interested in how to preserve privacy online!
