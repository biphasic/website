I graduated with a PhD in neuromorphic engineering from Sorbonne University because I think that technology can learn a thing or two from how biological systems process information. I work with event cameras that are inspired by the human retina and spiking neural networks that mimic our brain in an effort to teach machines to compute a bit more like humans do. I'm co-founder of [Neurobus](https://neurobus.space) and [Open Neuromorphic](https://open-neuromorphic.org) to pursue those goals!
