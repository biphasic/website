I am interested in the intersection of the human body and machines, which lead me to do a PhD in neuromorphic engineering. At the Vision institute in Paris, France I experimented with event-based sensors that are inspired by the human eye and spiking neural networks which mimic the way biological organisms process information. I love to build open source software which hopefully helps to accelerate research in that direction.
