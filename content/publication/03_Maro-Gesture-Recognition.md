abstract = "Gesture recognition is an area of research that is expandingas it would allow facilitated interaction with modern hand-held devices for the naive user. Currently, smart-phones and tablets are not commonly used by some groups such as the visually-impaired and  the elderly, because they require fine motor control and a good visual accuracy. Gesture recognition plays a key role in having these user categoriesto interact with IT devices. To our knowledge, this is the first prototype that performs real-time gesture recognition while  running exclusively on the smart-phone - no cloud computing - for dynamic gestures. Event-based cameras (EBC) mimic the way biologicaleyes  operate: each pixel is independent and asynchronous, and reacts only to its own field of view. This resulting output is a spatio-temporal point cloud at high temporal precision, instead of frames as with conventional cameras. EBC present a very high dynamic range that allows  them to function in non-controlled light environments."
