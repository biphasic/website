# Reclaiming my digital space
Over the past years I started to take back the control of my data online. I deleted a bunch of accounts, some of which I replaced with an open source service. Although I had some doubts as to whether I would seriously miss some of the 'free' services out there, I have to say that it has been a smooth and very rewarding ride so far.
It can be hard to argue why digital privacy is necessary when there are so many other problems that threaten humanity out there. But I strongly believe that privacy is a key element for a functioning and free society. In the information age that we are in now, this concept has become somewhat opaque, while we citizens have become transparent.

## Why even bother?
What does digital privacy really matter in the end? Do I really take any harm if a private company or a government knows what I like and who I talk to? After all it's convenient, right? I think there are multiple aspects to those questions.

First of all it should be clear that being careless about the traces left online can have direct consequences. Ads become tailored to what you like and talk about. Ever saw an ad pop up about something that you just talked about with your friend? That's [no coincidence](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/smartphone-apps-listening-privacy-alphonso-shazam-advertising-pool-3d-honey-quest-a8139451.html). Then you might think, well, I'm not influenced by ads. I'm afraid a global [560 billion US Dollar](https://www.statista.com/topics/990/global-advertising-market/) industry does make sure that they get their returns. Everyone is affected by ads. Whether that is a bad idea might be debatable, but I'd really rather have the choice.

Turns out companies know [a lot about you](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/607938/google-now-tracks-your-credit-card-purchases-and-connects-them-to-its-online-profile-of-you/) even if [you opt out](https://www.businessinsider.com/google-lawsuit-app-tracking-without-permission-reuters-2020-7) of their programs. And if you are someone who earns a decent salary, you could end up [paying more](https://www.csmonitor.com/Business/Saving-Money/2016/0405/How-retailers-use-dynamic-pricing-to-get-you-to-pay-more) for the same thing online.

Then there are indirect consequences. People reportedly behave differently when they know that they are being monitored. It might just be that one joke that you decide not to tell on the telephone or you might decide not to search for that term because you are going to take a flight to the US the next morning. But small things go a long way and eventually people get used to it.

The simple truth is: you just haven't realised your own worth online yet. Let me explain. You might be happy that a service such as facebook or gmail is free to use, but you're providing those companies with organic data that has essentially become _the new oil_. They are making huge profits from it, so why not claim a piece of the pie? I expect that at some point we will be able to sell some of our data rather than giving it away for free. There are already [companies](https://datacoup.com/) building business models on this.
As Andrew Trask, the clever mind behind [PySyft](https://github.com/OpenMined/PySyft), puts it: We're [spilling our data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zrU54VIK6k) everywhere, much like people 200 years ago disposed of their waste in the public. Was that healthy? Surely not.


## Is there a way out?
There always is. I think the hardest part is to question the need of some services out there.

Once a measure of surveillance is in place, it is hard to get rid of it.

Bare in mind that it's never too late to start taking ownership of your data. Companies are interested in recent trends, so if you replaced a service right now it might not affect how you are targeted immediately, but eventually your information will become out of date.


To that end, it baffles me that 1 out of 5 households in the UK now has a smart speaker at home. One might think that Orwell's 1984 would remind people of the [Telescreens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telescreen) in everyone's home.

At the very least, use an adblocker. There are [other plugins](https://privacybadger.org/) that I've found personally very useful. They are available as plugins for all major browsers.

Surveillance, once in place, is hard to get rid of.

If you make sensitive searches related to your health, your sexual preference or anything else you might prefer others not to know, use [Tor browser](https://www.torproject.org/).

I can highly recommend Edward Snowden's book [Permanent Record](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46223297-permanent-record).

In the end it boils down to a trade-off between freedom and security. Do tailored ads and WhatsApp backdoors limit your freedom? Certainly. Will a Big Brother government ensure safety for its well-behaving citizens? [Certainly](). We just have to be careful not to lose both in the end.
