Don't do evil.

What follows is a step by step guide to increase your privacy online, sorted by subjective level of difficulty.

3) Goodbye Search. Have you ever looked at your search history? I'm using DuckDuckGo on a daily basis these days. I really like some of their features, like being able to switch Country and the Duckbang. If you're not satisfied with the search results, you can still add a !g to the end of your query

1) Goodbye Chrome. Sure, it's fast. But since Firefox Quantum was released in December 2017, it's not actually much faster any more.

2) Goodbye Drive. There are plenty of alternatives available, even if you don't want to host yourself. Have a special look at Nextcloud


4) Goodbye Gmail. This is a tough one. Self-hosting is not an option for the standard user, so consider one of these alternatives.

5) Goodbye WhatsApp, Hangouts, Allo, Messages.

6) Goodbye Photos. If you have the Google Photos app installed, it actually analyses the pictures you take and sends regular updates to G servers.

7) Calendar & Contacts. This is only feasible if you have a CalDav server that you can synchronise your personal data with. Once it's set up, this is a nobrainer really.

8)

What did I not include in this list on purpose? PGP, Mastodon and are all services that may be nice. But why use them if you'll be the only one?

So do I still use proprietary services? Of course I do.

 looked at the proprietary services I was using and asked myself how much I really needed them. Most of the times there was a serious open source alternative that I could replace it with.


Thought: if we become lazy regarding privacy, we end up like people from Wall-E



[//]: # "The ever growing list of [known data breaches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_data_breaches) due to really poor security is getting longer by the day.

Turns out companies know [a lot about you](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/607938/google-now-tracks-your-credit-card-purchases-and-connects-them-to-its-online-profile-of-you/)

You can [cloak your photos](http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/%7Eravenben/publications/abstracts/fawkes-usenix20.html) so that facial recognition software doesn't work anymore.

If you're using a lot of 'smart' technology at home, you could [run a check](https://iotinspector.org/) to see how much data they're sending home.

If you're paranoid, check [this site](https://prism-break.org/en/) with OS-specific advice.

and its urgency will only become more apparent as we continue our path in a digital society.
And it's not just companies who are interested in your online activity, as you are surely aware of since Edward Snowden broke rank.
