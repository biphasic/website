summary: "A journey through the Moroccan desert for star gazing and cultural exploration."
---

When I was 22, I went to New Zealand with my dad and experienced one of the most memorable star gazing nights on Mount Cook, with stars visible in the clear skies of a no flight zone, down to the horizon. It was magical, and I wanted to do something similar with my wife. Star gazing is best done in remote places, and because I had never been to the African continent, I thought why not go to the desert? I looked up the date for New Moon, when the night is darkest, 6 months in advance. This is how our trip to the Moroccan desert came about. 

From London, we flew directly to Ouarzazate, which is East of the Atlas mountains. In our rented car, we drove via Tinghir to Merzouga, to make our way to the Sahara via the _route of 1000 Kasbahs_, which are castles from as early as the 11th century.

## Ouarzazate - lots of Kasbahs
Luckily for us London dwellers, there's a direct Ryanair flight to Ouarzazate, which is quite a drastic change of scenery. Taking off at the warehouse that is Stansted in cold weather, in a flight that was at ~15% capacity, you step on the tarmac to sunshine and 25 degrees at a tiny airport. If you happen to fly there as well, make sure you buy and install your esim before takeoff, as there's no wifi at the airport and mobile data roaming costs are exorbitant. For the night, we stayed at Berbère Palace, where we ordered 2 couscous and a salad, but what they brought us was food for two days!  

From Ouarzazate it's about a 40 minute drive to Aït Benhaddou, a Berber castle that is a UNESCO World Heritage site. Scenes from both Gladiator and a dozen other movies were filmed there. It was impressive to see, and full of local artists that exhibited their artworks. We hired a local guide for 200 Dirham, that's about 20 Euros, to show us around and explain the rich history of the Kasbah.

The second Kasbah we visited was Taourirt, directly in Ouarzazate, again with a local guide. It was under renovation because of an earthquake in 2023. He told us about how the Amazhir, the people living in the area before the Arabs arrived, became known as Berber, and the multitude of French, Arabic and Amazhir culture, while sharing a cup of mint tea. Did you know that in Morocco they use three alphabets? Arabic, Latin, and Tamazhir.

*Tamazight is spoken across Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, and parts of Mauritania—mainly in mountainous and Saharan regions by Amazigh (Berber) communities.*

In town, my wife found a wonderfully decorated [French restaurant](https://maps.app.goo.gl/PYYQKVRxR3W3SQpC7) with an indoor pool and great food. After some days of eating tagine and couscous, it was a welcome change. 

## Tinghir - beautiful palm groves 
About a 2.5h drive to the East, in an oasis, is Tinghir, a remote town with beautiful palm groves. We stopped at a peaceful [café with a fish pond](https://maps.app.goo.gl/pWy6PrqDXQg52Uku7) from which we went on an idyllic hike in the shadows of palm trees, crossing a river, walking through the ruins of an old kasbah, and returning to the cafe for some mint tea. It was one of those serendipitous encounters, and I highly recommend it if you make it to Tinghir. Close by, another walk took us through the [Todgha gorge](https://maps.app.goo.gl/N56djVt13mZ3ui1u7) with cliffs 300m high on either side. Back at the hotel, we joined the hotel staff playing traditional Berber music in the evening. Because I knew a bit of percussion, we immediately bonded, so before leaving the hotel, they surprised us with an authentic Moroccan experience by making us wear their traditional wedding outfits, so we could get married a second time! The staff at Maison d'hôte Igrane was incredibly friendly and made the stay in Tinghir feel like an authentic experience.

## Merzouga and desert camp
The [Sahara Pearl](https://maps.app.goo.gl/NzeNGQrVF8fVczNRA) hotel close to Merzouga is located at the border to the Sahara, and offers postcard views of a scenery that could be in Aladdin. This was the best hotel we stayed at, because of its breathtaking views in combination with a modern room (the hotel was built in 2024). We rode camels, sandboarded, and watched the sun rise and set, casting dramatic shadows on the dunes. Most of the time we just chilled at the pool though and ordered food!

Then finally came our night at the Sahara Stars desert camp, during new moon. After a 30 minute camel ride with 4x4s racing past to move luggage and goods to and from the camp, we arrived at a tent village, with private bathrooms, air conditioning and a restaurant. I have to say that I expected a more intimate setting with a few tents, but our camp was one of many in the area. After the lights went out at 11pm, it was star gazing time, and lying on top of a dune, I watched the beautiful night sky, with lights only visible on the horizon in the distance. It felt very magical! I took all the photos with my Pixel phone using 4 minute exposures, leaning against a chair. They turned out not bad, I think!

## Marrakech 
Our last stop were two nights in Marrakech after taking a domestic flight from Errachidia. Upon arrival, the traffic there was out of this world, something I haven't seen before. The taxi app (try [inDrive](https://indrive.com/)) told me to wear a seatbelt, but most of the cars simply didn't use any. We stayed in the Medina, the old town, in a Ryad near Bab Aylan. The Medina is full of narrow streets lined with market stalls that try to cram as much stuff in there as possible. Many streets are bustling with tourists, and normally you'd think that it's about as packed as it can get. And then there's the motorscooters, the bikes and even taxis that whizz past you, regardless. It does take a while to get used to, but it does seem to work out for people. We visited [Madrassa Ben Youssef](https://maps.app.goo.gl/7hmHj7mYMEA268rdA), a 16th-century Islamic school renowned for its stunning Moroccan-Andalusian architecture, the [House of Photography](https://maps.app.goo.gl/iYWP7monMAQEgkw9A) with many portraits from the last century, the [Yves Saint Laurent museum](https://maps.app.goo.gl/eyEsVS83WLK4pVfh6), which was a bit underwhelming, and the spa at the [Royal Mansour hotel](https://maps.app.goo.gl/JuCNShw1UwVDTbDv7), a luxury resort. For eating out I recommend the [Oban](https://maps.app.goo.gl/m5QAge9s4Zk3DUYE9) restaurant with great French cuisine and cocktails.

Overall I was very pleased with our trip to the Moroccan desert. It's easily accessible from Europe, not too touristy (apart from Marrakech) and reasonably priced. You'll get more in-depth conversations with locals if you know French, but you'll get by with English as well. Some people rent drivers that take them from Marrakech to the desert and up to Fes/Casablanca, but we didn't want to spend 10+ hours in the car for each of those trips. Driving was no problem at all, the roads were in great condition. Just watch out for speeding tickets, as they can be extremely accurate about that. 
Cash is king in the remote areas, so make sure you withdraw enough to pay for restaurants and hotels if you want to avoid a 3-5% card fee. Haggling is part of buying things, especially so in Marrakech. 
I found people to be really friendly, and everyone was open for a chat. Although streets are sometimes very dimly lit at night, it was always safe. There is also a lot of police present. 
The trip through the valley of 1000 kasbahs felt special because it was authentic, we got in touch with the locals, we admired the beautiful nature, and because the scenery of the Sahara is breathtaking.
