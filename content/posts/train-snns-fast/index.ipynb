    "When training a spiking neural network (SNN), one might think about how the learning rate or model size affect training time. But when it comes to training *faster*, optimizing data movement is crucial. 3 out of the first 4 points in [this list](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/kvs1ex/d_here_are_17_ways_of_making_pytorch_training/) weighted after potential speed-up have to do with how data is shaped and moved around between actual computations. It makes a huge difference, because training faster means getting results faster!\n",

We know that samples of audio input data in this dataset are 0.8-1.2s long across 700 frequency channels at microsecond resolution. We'll [downsample](https://tonic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/generated/tonic.transforms.Downsample.html#tonic.transforms.Downsample) each sample to 100 channels, [bin](https://tonic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/generated/tonic.transforms.ToFrame.html#tonic.transforms.ToFrame) events every 4 ms to one frame and [cut](https://tonic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/generated/tonic.transforms.CropTime.html#tonic.transforms.CropTime) samples that are longer than 1s.

Given that we might train for 100 epochs, which looks at each sample 100 times, that's a lot of wasted compute! Now we're going to cache, which means save, those transformed samples to disk during the first epoch, so that we don't need to recompute them later on! To do this we simply wrap our previous dataset in a [DiskCachedDataset](https://tonic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/data_classes.html#tonic.DiskCachedDataset) and provide the cache path. When a new sample is about to be loaded, that class will first check if the transformed sample is already in the cache on disk and if it isn't, it will retrieve the original sample, apply the transform, cache it to disk and then serve it. This caching process slows down training in the first epoch, but it pays off afterwards!\n",

    "We're down to less than 9s per epoch for the EXODUS model, which is another 40% less than disk-caching and an almost 15-fold improvement over the original Sinabs model using the na誰ve dataloading approach! Now we're really exploiting the GPU as much as possible with a utilisation percentage of ~99%. All this without any qualitative impact on gradient computation. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "The principle of caching can be applied to any data that you apply deterministic transformations to, but it pays off particularly well for event-based data. By using cached samples and not having to recompute the same transformations every time, we save ourselves a lot of time during training. If the data already sits on the GPU when it is requested, the speedup is really high. After all, there is a reason why neural network accelerators heavily optimise memory caching to minimise time and energy spent on data movement. So when should you use either disk- or GPU-caching?\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Disk-caching**: Broadly applicable, useful if you apply deterministic transformations to each sample and you train for many epochs. Not ideal if you're low on disk space.\n",
    "* **GPU-caching**: Only really suitable for small datasets and a bit more intricate to setup, but well worth the effort if you want to explore many different architectures / training parameters due to the speed of iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a last note, you might be wondering why we don't cache to the host memory instead of reading from a disk cache. This is totally possible, but the bottleneck at that point really is moving the data onto the GPU, which takes time. Whether the data sits in host memory or is loaded from disk using multiple worker threads doesn't make much of a difference, because the GPU cannot handle the data movement. Since on disk we have much more space available than in RAM, we normally choose to do that.\n",
